TODOs in this file unlike TODOs in project files, are intended to be long term goals whereas TODOs in files are supposed to be more short term.
TODO: Optimize the project's abstractions
TODO: Rename voxel terminology to be more consistent and precise
TODO: Clean up logic
TODO: Document remaining classes
TODO: Add assertions to prevent stupid bugs.
TODO: Remake face system so it's more extendable
TODO: Stop Browserify from de-optimizing the code such that it can run on ancient computers because it's really not going to work either way and it just makes the app run slower.
TODO: Clean up internal comments
